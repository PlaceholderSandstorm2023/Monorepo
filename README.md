# Reflections
This project was built for the 2023 Solana Sandstorm
hackathon, and therefore,
in its current state this project serves mostly as a 
proof of concept. The contract is deployed to devnet,
but the frontend is not currently hosted anywhere.
Further feature, and quality improvements are required
before this project might be productions ready.
This is my first crack at writing a complete Solana
based application, and I had a lot of fun :).

## What's good
A completely automated bounty management solution, only requiring
a handful of additions to issue, and pull request descriptions,
as well as an entry in contributors profile repo README

## Future improvements
- Storing private keys in the github secret store is a naive solution.
Poses a security threat to project owners funds.
- Using magic strings to handle automation is a brittle solution.
Growing my knowledge of Github Apps to offer a more robust UX in
the future is desirable
- I am very bad at CSS
